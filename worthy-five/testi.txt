Worthy Five: Luis Mendo

Five recommendations by Tokvo-based illustrator and artist Luis Mendo
---
A question worth asking:
Will this thing I really want actually enrich my life?' We often confuse price with value - what something costs and what it brings to our lives. I try to remind myself of this before every purchase I make.

A quote worth repeating:
Stan Dale is quoted for having said: "All human behaviour is either an act of love or a cry for love." It's such a critical way of looking at the world: you can't hate others for just wanting to be loved. We are all full of fears which are sometimes expressed through rage or - sadly - even violence.

A video worth watching:
I was obsessed with this long interview with Henri Cartier Bresson for a while. He offers lessons on humility and the unimportance of yourself and your tools. His English is a little hard to follow, but worth watching in full!

A Twitter account worth following:
I like following French publisher Thomas Ragon as he regularly shares illustrations and art from often unknown masters from the past.

A piece of advice worth passing on:
Self-initiated work will more heavily shape your career than 'client work!. We should always do something creative outside of our typical professional obligations. It makes us feel alive and will, eventually, bring new jobs/opportunities our way.
